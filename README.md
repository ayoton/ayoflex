# Advanced CSS layout utility library

AyoFlex is a modern open source CSS layout utility library based on `flex` layout module with twelve columns grid system to build mobile first responsive web interfaces. Ayoflex includes six default breakpoints known as responsive modifiers. These breakpoints can be customized using our source Sass file.

## Documentation


### You can find everything fully documented at the [Official Website](https://ayoflex.ayolib.com).


## Installation

To use AyoFlex on your project, you can use the pre-compiled css file and also can install the scss files so that you can customize it by yourself.


## Packages

You can then easily import style to your existing CSS/SCSS/SASS file:

#### Import css in your stylesheet
